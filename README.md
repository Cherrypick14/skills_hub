# `skills_hub`

Welcome to your new `skills_hub` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

## Overview
**Skills Hub** is an innovative platform designed to manage users, their skills, learning interests, and educational resources on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It aims to foster a collaborative learning environment where users can enhance their skills and knowledge by connecting with peers and sharing valuable resources.

## Core Features

### User Management
- **Add User**: Allows new users to join the platform by providing their skills and learning interests.
- **Update User**: Enables users to update their profiles with new skills and interests.
- **Matchmaking**: Matches users based on their learning interests and available skills, facilitating peer-to-peer learning and collaboration.

### Resource Management
- **Add Resources**: Users can contribute learning resources categorized by type, such as articles, videos, or tutorials.
- **Retrieve Resources**: Users can easily find relevant learning materials by retrieving resources based on category.

## Project Goals
- **Enhance Learning**: By connecting users with similar interests and skills, Skills Hub promotes a collaborative and interactive learning environment.
- **Resource Sharing**: Encourages the sharing of valuable educational resources to help users improve their knowledge and skills.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: The platform is designed with a flexible architecture to allow for future expansion and integration of new features.

## Technologies Used
- **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**: Leveraging the decentralized and scalable capabilities of the ICP.
- **Rust**: Utilized for backend development to ensure robust and efficient data handling.
- **Candid Interface**: Defines the interaction interface, ensuring seamless communication between the front end and back end.

- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd skills_hub/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
